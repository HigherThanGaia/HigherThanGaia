          <b>Peter Derek Vaughan Prince</b> (14 August 1915 – 24 September 2003) 
          was a Bible teacher whose daily radio programme, Derek Prince Legacy 
          Radio, is broadcast around the world in various languages.

        <h2 padding: 20px 40px 60px 70px;>Early years [<a href="">about</a>]</h2>

        <p padding: 20px;>
          Derek Prince was born in India to British parents and was a 
          scholar of Greek and Latin, attending both Eton College and 
          Cambridge University.[1]
        </p>

      </div>

      <div id="section1">

        <p>
          At university he described himself as an atheist, but while 
          serving with the British army in World War II, he began 
          studying the Bible and became a Christian.[1]
        </p>

        <h2>Marriage and the growth of his ministry</h2>

        <p>
          Prince married Danish missionary Lydia Christensen in 1946, 
          becoming father to her eight adopted daughters before 
          the couple adopted another daughter.
        </p>

        <p>
          The family moved to the USA in 1963 and pastored a church in 
          Seattle.[1] Prince worked at the Faith Tabernacle in Chicago,and 
          then moved to Good News Church in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.
        </p>

        <p>
          In May 1971 Derek Prince Publications opened offices in Ft. 
          Lauderdale, Florida.[2] Derek Prince Publications became Derek Prince Ministries in December 1990.[3]
        </p>

        <p>
          Lydia died in 1975, and Prince married Ruth Baker (who had three adopted children) in 1978. They moved 
          to Jerusalem in 1981.[1]
        </p>

      </div>

      <div id="section2">

        <p>
          The Princes traveled extensively in ministry until Ruth died on 29 December 1998. The following list of 
          countries covers their ministry from 1993 to 1998. Some of these countries were visited more than once: 
          Russia, Germany, Kazakhstan, Hungary, South Africa, Kenya, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Turkey, 
          Poland, Bahrain, Cuba, Colombia, Switzerland, France, Portugal, India and England.[4]
        </p>

        <p>
          He is the author of 51 books, 600 audio and 100 videos, many of which has been translated and published in 
          more than 60 languages. Some of the subjects that are covered in his teachings are prayer and fasting,[5] 
          foundations of the Christian faith,[6] spiritual warfare,[7] God's love[8] and marriage and family.
          [9] His daily radio is translated into Arabic, Chinese (Amoy, Cantonese, Mandarin, Shanghainese, 
          Swatow), Croatian, German, Malagasy, Mongolian, Russian, Tamil, Samoan, Spanish, Bahasa Indonesia, 
          Tongan, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Hindi and many other languages. The radio program continues to reach 
          many people around the world.[citation needed]
        </p>

        <p>
          Derek Prince Ministries continued for the rest of his life to distribute his teachings and to train 
          missionaries, church leaders, and congregations.[10]

      <div id="section3">

          <h2>Demons and deliverance [<a href="">about</a>]</h2>

          <P>
            As a Pentecostal, Prince believed in the reality of spiritual forces operating in the world, and of 
            the power of demons to cause illness and psychological problems. While in Seattle, he was asked to 
            perform an exorcism on a woman, and he came to believe that Christians could be "demonized"
            [11] (normally described as "possessed" by demons – Prince avoided this term which implies 
            ownership).[12][13] This was at odds with the more usual Pentecostal view that demons could possess 
            unbelievers, but could only oppress Christians. Prince believed that his deliverance ministry used 
            the power of God to defeat demons.[14]
          </P>

          <h2>Israel [<a href="">about</a>]</h2>

          <p>
            Prince strongly opposed replacement theology. His book The 
            Destiny of Israel and the Church argues that the Church has 
            not replaced Israel and that the covenant that God made with the 
            nation of Israel still stands today. Prince also believed that 
            the creation of the state of Israel was the fulfillment of 
            biblical prophecy. Derek states in his book Promised Land, 
            "The central theme of biblical prophecy, as it is being 
            unfolded in our time, revolves around the land and the people 
            of Israel. God is carrying out His predetermined plan to 
            regather the Jewish people from their worldwide dispersion
            and restore them to their ancient homeland."[15]
          </p>

          <h3>Shepherding movement [<a href="">about</a>]</h3>

          <p>
            Prince created the Shepherding movement with fellow ministers Don Basham, Bob Mumford, 
            Charles Simpson and Ern Baxter, who became known as the 'Fort Lauderdale Five.' They sought 
            to counter what were seen as excesses within the Charismatic Movement, by emphasizing discipleship and 
            pastoral care. The practice of 'personal submission to spiritual authorities' was considered 
            controversial.[16] Prince's association with the Shepherding movement provided international exposure. 
            After leaving the movement, he focused on his own international ministry.[17]
